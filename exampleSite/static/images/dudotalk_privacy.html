    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  </p>

  <p>We/ DudoTalk, are an internet based mobile phone application by M/s ZILJ TECH Private Limited, and this document uses the words “we” and DudoTalk interchangeably, and “you” and “users” interchangeably. The expression “we” covers both DudoTalk and M/s ZILJ TECH Private Limited, as and when the context allows.</p>

  <p>The users’ right to privacy is of paramount importance to DudoTalk community.</p>
  <p>We take data security and privacy with critical importance. We obligate ourselves to maintain a no-leak and no-disclosure business as any private and sensitive data must receive proportioned protection. In our application, users and providers / ‘listeners’, are in control and can decide what they want to share and what they prefer to keep private.</p>
  <p>-   Any information you share with us by your own choosing is ‘redacted’, ‘obscure’, and ‘censored’ from everyone, including the employees of DudoTalk, as well as the external ‘listeners’ we bring in, for your engagement.</p>
  <p>-   The information or data you share with our ‘listeners’ or otherwise, is for “your eyes only”. We only retain the basic minimum information like name, age, email ID, for the registration process.</p>
  <p>-   We do not send you messages without your permission.</p>
  <p>-   We send promotional messages with an option to opt-out at any time.</p>
  <p>-   We do not share data with any third party, whatsoever.</p>

  <p>However, DudoTalk may, with your implied permission, use the basic information and data provided by you, to provide a more personalized online experience.</p>
  <p>DudoTalk stores any data entered by the user, in a very secured format deterring any leakage or misuse.</p>
  <p>No “sensitive personal data” is collected or stored and used as per the required legal guidelines. We emphasize and actively inform all users to avoid sharing any “sensitive personal data” with anyone related to, or connected to, or representing DudoTalk.</p>
  <p>The only purpose of collecting any basic or required information is to provide you with a more secure experience to the real-time users and enable the ‘listeners’ to address and engage the users, coherently and cogently.</p>
  <p>In general, you can visit DudoTalk’s portal without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when DudoTalk may need information from you. Only in such incidences, as disclosed, DudoTalk reserves the right to gather the information and use it according to the terms mentioned.</p>
  <p>DudoTalk does not rent, sell, or share personal or any other form of information about you to anyone, including non-affiliates, except to provide the services as agreed or intended to be generally provided through the DudoTalk application or any other service you've specifically requested, when DudoTalk has your permission.</p>
  <p>DudoTalk provides your redacted and censored information to unspecified listeners (as defined in the disclaimer) who timely engage with DudoTalk under strict confidentiality agreements and non-disclosure contracts.</p>
  <p>However, DudoTalk as per law, is legally bound to disclose information that any government organization with proper instructions from the court of law, in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.</p>

  <p>DudoTalk is a portal which brings two individual set of parties at the same platform. Though we cannot be held directly or vicariously liable by conduct or disclosure of either party (considering we do not ask for any personal or typical information to be disclosed by either party or monitor the information shared at our mobile application), we do go to extra lengths to ensure your rights are protected and privacy is maintained at all costs.</p>
